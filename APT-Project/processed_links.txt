The first season centers on a group of teenage theater enthusiasts (played by Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett, Matt Cornett, Sofia Wylie and others) who participate in a staging of High School Musical: The Musical as their school production. The series is set at a fictionalized version of East High School (pictured), where the original High School Musical film series was filmed. Several cast members from the film series appear in guest roles. Critics have highlighted the performances of Bassett and Rodrigo, and have compared the series to Glee for its music and themes. There has been a mixed reception to the program's mockumentary format. The series won a GLAAD Media Award and was nominated for five Children's and Family Emmy Awards. The third season premiered in July 2022; a fourth season is in production. (Full article...)

It is a small butterfly that can be found throughout the Palearctic realm, where it occurs primarily in grasslands rich in chalk. Males are a pale blue colour, while females are dark brown; both have chequered fringes around their wings. This mating pair of chalkhill blues was photographed at Aston Rowant National Nature Reserve in Oxfordshire, England. The species breeds and produces a new generation only once per year.

Distinguished author Mary Agnes Chase 1869–1963. Standard IPNI form: Chase Mary Agnes Chase, née Merrill, was an American botanist who worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution. She is considered one of the world's outstanding agrostologists and is known for her work on the study of grasses, and also for her work as a suffragist. Chase was born in Iroquois County, Illinois and held no formal education beyond grammar school. That aside, she made significant contributions to the field of botany, authored over 70 scientific publications, and was conferred with an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Illinois. She specialized in the study of grasses and conducted extensive field work in North- as well as and South America. Her Smithsonian Field Books collection from 1897 to 1959 is archived in the Smithsonian Institution Archives. In 1901, Chase became a botanical assistant at the Field Museum of Natural History under Charles Frederick Millspaugh, where her work was featured in two museum publications: Plantae Utowanae (1900) and Plantae Yucatanae (1904). Two years later, Chase joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a botanical illustrator and eventually became a scientific assistant in systematic agrostology (1907), assistant botanist (1923), and associate botanist (1925), all under Albert Spear Hitchcock. Chase worked with Hitchcock for almost twenty years, collaborating closely and also publishing, for instance The North American Species of Panicum (1910). Following Hitchcock's death in 1936, Chase succeeded him to become senior botanist in charge of systematic agrostology and custodian of the Section of Grasses, Division of Plants at the United States National Museum (USNM). Chase retired from the USDA in 1939, but continued her work as custodian of the USNM grass herbarium until her death in 1963. She was an Honorary Fellow of the Smithsonian Institution (1959) and Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (1961). Agnesia is named in her honour (a monotypic genus of herbaceous South American bamboo in the grass family). Chase experienced discrimination based on her gender in the scientific field, for example, being excluded from expeditions to Panama in 1911 and 1912 because the expedition's benefactors feared the presence of women researchers would distract men. During World War I, Chase marched with Alice Paul and was jailed several times for her activities. In 1918, she was arrested at the Silent Sentinels rally picketing the White House; she refused bail and was held for 10 days, where she instigated a hunger-strike and was force-fed. The USDA accused her of "conduct unbecoming a government employee," but Hitchcock helped her keep her job. Chase was also an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). See also: Distinguished authors of previous months. Species of the month Humpback Anglerfish or Johnson's Blackdevil Melanocetus johnsonii Some facts on this fish: Length: Males: up to 3 cm. Females: up to 20 cm. Number of teeth: Upper jaw: 29–178. Lower jaw: 32–142. Diet: Crustaceans. Range: Tropical to temperate parts of all oceans; depth from 700 to 2000 meters. First described: By the British zoologist Albert Günther in 1864. Melanocetus johnsonii has a mouth full of teeth and a lantern on its nose. The female's snout ends in a "fishing rod"-a glowing blob of light that contains millions of light-producing bacteria. It acts as a lure to attract prey. The males are tiny, lack teeth and have extremely large nostrils and a powerful sense of smell to aid in locating females. They can detect a special pheromone that the female releases. This deep-water fish is capable of catching and swallowing prey larger than itself. Belongs to the genus Melanocetus or Black Seadevils, which contains 5 species, and forms a separate family-Melanocetidae.

April’s featured text Grab a download! R. U. R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) is a 1920 science-fiction play by the Czech writer Karel Čapek. The play had its world premiere on 2 January 1921 in Hradec Králové, Czechoslovakia. Already in 1921, it was translated into English by Paul Selver, and was adapted for the stage in English by Nigel Playfair in 1922. The American premiere was at the Garrick Theatre in New York City in October 1922, where it ran for 184 performances, a production in which Spencer Tracy and Pat O'Brien played robots in their Broadway debuts. Helena was portrayed by Kentuckian actress and antiwar activist Mary Crane Hone in her Broadway debut. By 1923, it had been translated into thirty languages, and it introduced the word "robot" to science fiction and to the English language. Central office of the factory of Rossum's Universal Robots. Entrance on the right. The windows on the front wall look out on the rows of factory chimneys. On the left more managing departments. Domin is sitting in the revolving chair at a large American writing table. On the left-hand wall large maps showing steamship and railroad routes. On the right-hand wall are fastened printed placards. ("Robot's Cheapest Labor," etc.) In contrast to these wall fittings, the floor is covered with a splendid Turkish carpet, a sofa, leather armchair, and filing cabinets. At a desk near the windows Sulla is typing letters. Domin: To E. M. McVicker and Co., Southampton, England. "We undertake no guarantee for goods damaged in transit. As soon as the consignment was taken on board we drew your captain's attention to the fact that the vessel was unsuitable for the transport of Robots, and we are therefore not responsible for spoiled freight. We beg to remain for Rossum's Universal Robots. Yours truly." [Sulla, who has sat motionless during dictation, now types rapidly for a few seconds, then stops, withdrawing the completed letter.] Ready? (Read on...) or see all featured texts.
